## Abstract

I chose to do my PBL on psychology because I feel fun in learning psychology, and I enjoy when learning more things about people, although I never touched them before. Before I felt like being a psychologist is like having “X-ray eyes”, they know all the things that people want to express from only one simple movement. By choosing the focus of body language and facial expression, it can let me learn more about people’s emotions and thoughts, which I think it's very cool.

## Body Language

Body language is an important thing to study in the field of law enforcement/science, is the movement and position of one’s body at any point in time. It's also a way of communication that uses your body. Body language specifically shows during social interactions. During social interactions, body language can tell us important things about how someone is feeling/ what someone is thinking. Body language includes: body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch, the use of space, and so on.

## Facial Expressions

Facial expressions are the motions and positions of your eyes, nose, ears, and mouth that are shown on your face. These movements show how people feel at that time. They are ways of communicating those emotions to their environment and those around them. Facial expressions are very important in people’s health, because facial expressions can show how people are thinking, which indicate an individual's intentions within a social situation.
