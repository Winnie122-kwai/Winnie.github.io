# A Peek into Facial Expressions, Body Language, and Psychology

## Abstract

I chose to do my PBL on psychology because learning psychology is fun for me. I enjoy learning more things about people, although I never met them in person before. Being a psychologist is like having “X-ray eyes”, they know almost all the things that people want to express or emotions they are hiding from only one simple movement. By choosing to focus on body language and facial expression, I hoped that this activity could let me learn more about people’s emotions and thoughts, which I think is fascinating.

### Why should we learn about Psychology?
Psychology helps you to understand yourself and other people, understand the aspects of human behavior everyday, the interactions with people, your learning and memory performance, and your ability to cope with pressure.


## Body Language

Body language is the movement and position of one’s body at any point in time. It's also a way of physically communicating by using your body. During social interactions, body language can tell us important things about how someone is feeling or what they may be thinking. Body language includes: body posture, gestures, eye movement, touch, the use of space, and so on. Studying body language has allowed certain fields of law enforcement and science to advance and make strides in the way they observe people.

### Why is it important to learn about body language? 

Body language is a good way to learn about and understand people in various contexts. The non-verbal communication seen through body language allows humans to express their emotions through body movements. Learning about body language can help us improve our own body language in both personal and professional settings. 

## Facial Expressions

Facial expressions are the motions and positions of your eyes, nose, ears, and mouth that are shown on your face. These movements show how people feel at that time. They are the most direct ways of communicating one’s emotions to their environment and those around them. Facial expressions are very important in people’s health, because facial expressions can show how people are thinking, which indicate an individual's intentions within a social situation. During my research, I also learned about microexpressions, which are significantly smaller and quicker changes of the face. Microexpressions are harder to notice, and tend to reveal much more about a person’s psychological state.
